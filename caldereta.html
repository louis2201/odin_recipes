    <h1>Beef Kaldereta</h1>
    <p>Beef Kaldereta is a rich and hearty Filipino stew known for its tender beef chunks slow-cooked in a flavorful tomato-based sauce. Infused with garlic, onions, and bell peppers, this dish gets its depth from liver spread, which adds a creamy, savory richness. Carrots, potatoes, and olives enhance its texture and taste, while a touch of chili gives it a mild kick. Often enjoyed during gatherings, this comforting dish pairs perfectly with steamed rice, making it a beloved staple in Filipino cuisine.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs beef chuck, sliced into cubes</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, sliced</li>
        <li>1 large potato, cubed</li>
        <li>1 small green bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>1 small red bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>1 Knorr Beef Cube</li>
        <li>1 can (8 oz) tomato sauce</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons liver spread</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li> 1 medium yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sauté Aromatics: Heat cooking oil in a pot over medium heat. Add chopped onions and crushed garlic; sauté until the onions become soft.</li>
        <li>Brown the Beef: Introduce the cubed beef into the pot. Cook for approximately 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the beef's exterior turns light brown.</li>
        <li>Incorporate Seasonings: Add dried bay leaves and chili flakes or crushed pepper to the pot. Stir the mixture to evenly distribute the spices.</li>
        <li>Add Liver Spread: Stir in the liver spread, ensuring it blends well with the beef and aromatics.</li>
        <li>Pour in Liquids: Pour the tomato sauce and beef broth into the pot. Stir to combine all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Simmer Until Tender: Bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer until the beef becomes tender. This typically takes about 30 minutes when using a pressure cooker or 1 to 2 hours with a regular pot.</li>
        <li>Add Vegetables: Once the beef is tender, add the sliced potatoes and carrots.</li>
    </ol>
