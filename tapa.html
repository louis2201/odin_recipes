    <h1>Beef Tapa</h1>
    <img src="./tapa.jpg" height="550" width="650">
    <p>Beef Tapa is a classic Filipino dish featuring thinly sliced beef marinated in a flavorful blend of soy sauce, calamansi juice, garlic, sugar, and black pepper. The meat is then pan-fried to achieve a tender yet slightly caramelized texture, balancing savory, tangy, and mildly sweet flavors. Often served with garlic rice and a sunny-side-up egg, this dish—popularly known as Tapsilog—offers a satisfying and hearty meal, perfect for breakfast or any time of the day.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup calamansi juice</li>
        <li>1 head garlic, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 Knorr Beef Cube</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>3 pounds beef sirloin, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Canola oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Marinade: In a non-reactive bowl, combine soy sauce, calamansi juice, minced garlic, sugar, salt, and pepper. Stir the mixture until the sugar and salt are fully dissolved.</li>
        <li>Marinate the Beef: Add the thinly sliced beef sirloin to the marinade. Massage the meat to ensure each piece is thoroughly coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight to allow the flavors to meld and to cure the meat.</li>
        <li>Drain the Beef: After marinating, remove the beef from the marinade and let any excess liquid drain off.</li>
        <li>Cook the Beef: Heat about one tablespoon of canola oil in a wide pan over medium heat. Place the marinated beef slices in a single layer in the pan. Cook, turning occasionally, for about 3 to 5 minutes, or until the liquid expelled from the meat is almost absorbed.</li>
        <li>Brown the Beef: If necessary, add more oil to the pan. Continue to cook the beef until it's lightly browned and caramelized to your desired level.</li>
        <li>Serve: Once cooked, remove the beef tapa from the pan. Serve hot, traditionally accompanied by garlic fried rice and sunny-side-up eggs for a classic Filipino "tapsilog" breakfast.</li>
    </ol>
