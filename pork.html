    <h1>Pork Adobo</h1>
    <p>Pork Adobo is a beloved Filipino dish known for its rich, savory, and slightly tangy flavor. 
        This recipe features tender pork simmered in a fragrant blend of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, 
        and black pepper, creating a deep umami taste with a hint of zest. As it slowly cooks, the meat absorbs the bold flavors, 
        resulting in a dish that is both hearty and comforting. Best served with steamed rice, 
        this classic favorite embodies the essence of Filipino home cooking—simple, flavorful, and satisfying.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs pork belly</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic, crushed</li>
        </li>5 dried bay leaves</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon peppercorn</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the Pork: In a bowl, combine the pork belly, soy sauce, and crushed garlic. Mix well, ensuring each piece is coated. Cover and marinate for at least 1 hour to let the flavors penetrate the meat.</li>
        <li>Sauté the Marinated Pork: Heat a pot over medium heat. Add the marinated pork belly, including the marinade and garlic. Cook for a few minutes until the pork starts to brown.</li>
        <li>Add Seasonings and Simmer: Pour in water, whole peppercorns, and dried bay leaves. Stir the mixture and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for 40 minutes to 1 hour, or until the pork becomes tender. If the liquid reduces too quickly, add more water as needed.</li>
        <li>Incorporate Vinegar: Pour the vinegar into the pot. Allow the mixture to re-boil without stirring. Let it simmer for an additional 12 to 15 minutes to meld the flavors together.</li>
        <li>Season to Taste: Taste the sauce and add salt if necessary, adjusting to your preference.</li>
        <li>Serve: Once the pork is tender and the sauce has reached your desired consistency, transfer the Pork Adobo to a serving dish. Serve hot, ideally with steamed rice.</li>
